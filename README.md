## Installation and customization

[Video guide](https://youtu.be/dRy1cG9nCTo)

### Installation

* Drop the "Among Us Follower" prefab onto your Avatar in the hierarchy.

### Customization

* Textures for different colors can be found in the textures folder.
* The Armature of the follower can be scaled.
* Increasing the "Follow Target" weight (base weight 0.008) in the "Follower Constraint" will make it move faster.
* Moving "Follow Target" will move the crewmates rest position that it will follow.
* Moving "Look At Target" inside of the follow target will change where the crewmate will be looking in its rest position.
* Changing the value of the last keyframe in the "SFX On" animation determines how loud the walking sound will be.
* The Armature, Mesh and Idle and Walk/Run Animations can be changed out for a different model, a more detailed explenation can be found in the video guide.
